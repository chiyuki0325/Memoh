Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- SSH hosts and aliases
- Anything environment-specific
- Preferred tools, commands, or workflows
- API quirks or workarounds you've discovered
- The user's preferred output formats

## Examples

```markdown
### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

## Self-Maintenance

Keep this file up to date as you learn:

- When you discover a new tool preference or shortcut, add it here.
- When the user corrects how you use a tool, record the right approach.
- When environment details change (new hosts, keys, paths), update accordingly.
- When you make a mistake with a tool, document it so future-you doesn't repeat it.

**Text > Brain** — if you want to remember it next session, write it down.
